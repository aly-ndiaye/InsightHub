# InsightHub — From Code to Intelligence

## Vision
InsightHub is an AI-driven data platform built to transform raw information into actionable intelligence.
It bridges data engineering, machine learning, and business analytics through an automated, cloud-ready architecture.

The project demonstrates how an intelligent data pipeline — from ingestion to visualization — can generate real business value by turning data into decisions.

---

## Architecture Overview
- **Data Layer** – PostgreSQL for structured, centralized storage.
- **Processing Layer** – Python (FastAPI, Pandas, SQLAlchemy) for transformation, enrichment, and machine learning readiness.
- **Intelligence Layer** – Power BI or Streamlit for KPI visualization and storytelling.
- **Interface Layer** – Streamlit or React for interactive exploration.
- **Automation Layer** – Docker, GitHub Actions, and Azure for CI/CD and deployment.

---

## Project Structure
- **backend/** – FastAPI application for data access and intelligent services.
- **db/** – Database schema, migrations, and initialization scripts.
- **frontend/** – Web interface and visual dashboards.
- **docs/** – Documentation and architecture diagrams.
